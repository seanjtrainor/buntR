# buntR

This is the repository for a shiny app that suggests whether or not a major league baseball team should bunt in a given situation. The
situations supported are when there are runners on first and/or second base with 0 or 1 outs. 

Data used can be found in the data folder. Bill Pretti's 'baseballR' package was used to scrape the pitch by pitch data, as well as calculate
key metrics such as wOBA and FIP.
